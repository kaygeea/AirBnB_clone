<h3>Project Description:</h3>
This is the first phase of a project to build a full web application based on a clone of the AirBnB website.
The first phase involves building most of the back-end utilities with Python. Some of which include:
<ol>
<li>A command interpreter console that uses the `cmd` module.</li>
<li>A parent class called `BaseModel` that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes as well as handle initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances.</li>
<li>An initial abstracted file storage engine for the project.</li>
<li>And as will apply to all other phases, unittesting to validate all classes and storage engine used in this phase</li>
</ol>
